  <a id="x1-1000"></a>Introduction</h3>

This project will take you through how to create and analyze nuclear abundances
of I129, pre and post a supernova explosion of a 25 solar mass star. Though this
will be centered around I129, the processes shown here can easily be 
extrapolated for any isotope one wishes to study.
<div>
I129 is a short lived radio-nuclide, meaning that any of it that was formed 
in the early Solar System is long extinct. It's abundances are inferred 
through the excesses of 129Xe which can be studied today.

\section*{Introduction}
This project will take you through how to create and analyze nuclear abundances
of $^{129}I$, pre and post a supernova explosion of a 25 $M_{\odot}$ star. 
Though this will be centered around $^{129}I$, the processes shown here can easily be extrapolated for any isotope one wishes to study.
$^{129}I$ is a short lived radio-nuclide, meaning that any of it that was formed
in the early Solar System is long extinct. It's abundances are inferred
through the excesses of $^{129}Xe$ which can be studied today.
